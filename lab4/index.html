<h1>Lab 4: File Transfer</h1>
<div id="challenge">
	<h2>Challenge</h2>
	<p>The challenge for this lab was to learn how to transfer our files, while also
		going over pair programming in class. For this lab, we have to test out our
		files in the web browser, checking to see if it works, and then upload them
		to the server. </p>

<h2>Problems</h2>
<div id="problems">
	<p>Some problems that my partner and I had were adding images with the correct
		sizing, trying to use the correct coding for the path, and also working
		the correct use of the arrows and quotations.</p>

<h3>Final Result</h3>
<div id="final result">
	<p>All of our files worked on the browers perfectly fine! Our main issues were
		definitely adding images and personally, I had issues on remebered what
		sort of code to use for certain areas on the html, but we resolved them
		and my partner, Vivian, helped me through it all!</p>
