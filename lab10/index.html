			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>For this lab, we are to style our text elements using colors, different
					fonts, borders, etc. We are also going to change our font sizes
					and the font families in order to further customize our sites.</p>

				<h2>Problem</h2>
					<p>I didn't really have any problems with this lab since my partner
						and I are already familiar with most of these styles. We have already
						experimented with colors for our backgrounds and fonts, but had trouble
						searching for fonts that we liked. For this lab, we did a bit of outside
						research for more font families, and I did have just a small issue
						for the border around my photo. The only thing I really struggled
						with was my image style. I'm trying to get it to zoom in, but I am
						trying to get it to stop at a certain point and I am unsure how.</p>

				<h2>Final Result</h2>
					<p>I am extremely happy with this lab! I really like the color that I chose
						for the background colors and I'm happy that the font is in cursive
						rather than regular print. I think if I just played around with
						the lab and rules/codes a bit and become more familiar, I can start
						messing around with the sites. :)</p>
