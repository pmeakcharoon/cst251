				<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Our challenge for this lab is to create a responsive design that
						can work on mobile devices as well as computers/laptops. The goal of this
						lab is to create a site that is responsive to where the site looks the same
						on all devices and isn't altered, stretched, squeezed, etc.<p>

				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I was a bit confused with this lab, so I had a few problems. I wasn't exactly
					sure where to start or add the code, so it was a struggle trying to get this
					to work. My media tag wasn't working for some reason, so I talked with my partner
					and she helped me figure it out. Another issue is my aside box not floating correctly
					and the black bar showing up around my footer again, but that's it.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="finalresult">
				<h2>Final Result</h2>
					<p>This is a simple layout, but I'm happy that I was able to do it and learn how
					to create something new. It's really interesting to me that a simple code
					can make my website so much more flexible to mobile devices and such. I am
					happy that my partner was able to help me through really rough times and we were both
					patient with each other and helped each other through the labs, so I am really
					appreciative of her. :)</p>
