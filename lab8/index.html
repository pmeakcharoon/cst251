			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge of this lab is to focus on css selectors; experimenting
					with the different classes and ids while styling each one. We are also
					going to style our images, so when we hover over it, it changes its
					size or shape. Mainly, we are just experimenting with different elements
					in order to style our site to be fun, creative, and interesting.</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>The problems that were reoccuring during this lab was just retesting
				our codes in the css file. Personally, I had issues ensuring that I was
				using the correct recipe or forms for the codes. It was also difficult
				getting the exact color that I wanted for the fonts and backgrounds in
				order to get them to compliment each other. It was also confusing trying
				to get the image to change sized when hovered over.</p>
