			<h3>A Bit of Me!</h3>
			<p> My real name is Patcha, but I grew up with people always calling me Polly
				or Paulina :). I am Thai with a bit of Japanese (and I believe Chinese) as well!
				I love skincare, beauty, and fashion (although I'm not very good at it, it still
				interests me and I just love cute clothing and cute makeup packaging),
				and I love to cook! One day, I hope to create my own cute little
				website or a cookbook filled with family recipes that are easy and help people
				feel at home or warm their heart when they're able to taste the foods!</p>

		<div id="challenge">
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge for this lab is to work with even more advanced
				block styling elements. We are to mess with the paddings, width,
				add sidebars, add links, etc. We are to also add color or images to our
			 	html.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="problem">
				<h2>Problem</h2>
					<p>The problems that my partner and I had were many things. Personally,
					I could not figure out how to do the sidebar or have a gif as my
			 		background image. Another problem that I had was formatting
					my site and making sure that it was to my liking. Toward the end of the lab,
					my parter was able to help with formatting and the sidebar, but we
					are both still confused on how to add a gif for my backgorund. </p>
				</div>

			<div id="finalresult">
				<h2>Final Result</h2>
					<p>It was difficult getting to the final result that I wanted due
					to having difficulty understanding how to add the sidebar and gif
					as a background. So far, the formatting of my site is nice, but
					it is something I'd like to improve on in the next lab.</p>
