</h1>Lab 3: File Structure</h1>
<div id="challenge">
	<h2>Challenge</h2>
	<p>For this lab, the challenge was to create properly strucutres files while
		also creating our homepages, organizing our projects, and also learning how
		to link to certain HTML files with ease. We explored concepts such as parent,
		sibling, and children files in order to understand the file structures
		as well as how to recognize them understandably. Vivian and I created our
		own homepages as well as bullet points with links to the different labs that
		we do in the CST251 course.

	<h2>Problems</h2>
	<div id="Problems">
		<p>The main issue that my partner and I had when we were working on the lab
			was incorporating our images of ourselves onto the code. We had issues
			on linking our images to the code, but we were able to figure out it! We
			also had some problems with sizing, but with previous experiences, we
			were also able to fix that with ease as well.
	</div>
	<h3>Final Result</h3>
	<div id=Final Results>
		<p>Our final results were satisfactory! We were able to incorporate our images
			while being able to size them to our liking, as well as create and learn
			about file structures.
