				<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this assignment is to create 5 different sketches for our final project,
					and we ae to do this assignment individually before coming together as a group to discuss
					our ideas and choose the best ones out of ALL of our sketches. <p>
			</div>

			<div id="problem">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't have any issues with this assignment since it was just creating
					really fast sketches of ideas for our final project. It was a bit hard to try to create interesting ideas,
					but I felt as though there was only so much to do with our final project idea to keep it interesting
					and not look like a simple information page. <p>
			</div>

			<div id="finalresult">
				<h2>Final Result</h2>
					<p>I think that even though the sketches that I did are pretty simple and look similar to each other,
					I think that they're pretty cute and unique compared to other websites. Our team came up with super
					cute ideas and I think we all have a similar plan in mind, so I am very excited to get together with them
					in order to discuss our ideas and create one together :)</p>

		<h2> Movie Idea 1</h2>
		<img src="img/movieidea1.jpg">
		<img src="img/movieinfo1.jpg">
		<p> This is my first sketch of my first idea! The boxes would be screencaps of specific movies,
			and once you click on the photo, it'll take you to a whole other page filled with information on the location
			as well as fun facts about the movie/location!<p>
	</div>

	<div id="movieidea2">
			<h2> Movie Idea 2</h2>
			<img src="img/movieidea2.jpg">
			<img src="img/movieinfo2.jpg">
			<p> This is my second idea. It'll be like taking a tour bus or a road trip to the different locations! Each
				road sign will be the location/entrance to the specific location, and once you click on the roadsign, it'll give
				information on the movie as well as fun facts.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="movieidea3">
			<h2> Movie Idea 3</h2>
			<img src="img/movieidea3.jpg">
			<img src="img/movieinfo3.jpg">
			<p>For this idea, I wanted to sketch out a little treasure map! It's pretty self explanatory, but I'm still unsure
				on what to put for each movie location or how it should be identified. I was just focusing on the map itself. </p>
	</div>

	<div id="movieidea4">
		<h2> Movie Idea 4</h2>
		<img src="img/movieidea4.jpg">
		<img src="img/movieinfo4.jpg">
		<p>I think it'd be cute if we did a little website based on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but instead of actors or singers,
			we put the movies instead! Each star will be a movie/location, and once you click on the star, it'll lead you to another
			page with more information. </p>
	</div>

	<div id="movieidea5">
		<h2> Movie Idea 5</h2>
		<img src="img/movieidea5.jpg">
		<img src="img/movieinfo5.jpg">
		<p> I wanted to do something similar to the treasure map, but put icons that represent the movie instead of a
			photo. Once you click on the icon, it'll take you to a different page discussing the location of the film as well as other
			movies that were filmed there.</p>
