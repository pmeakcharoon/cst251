		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>For this lab, we are to explore styling block elements in our css. We
			are to personalize our sites while editing the css block elements and
			customizing it to our own tastes. Adding margins, different colored
			backgrounds and fonts, etc., are things that we can incorporate or edit
			when doing this lab.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>The main problem that I had was adding color as a background. I tried to
			use the color codes that I searched for on Google, but it wasn't working
			for some reason.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="result">
		<h2>Final Results</h2>
		<p>I would prefer for my final results to be a bit different from lab8's result,
			but we learn as we go! I was able to figure out the css and color difficulty
			that I had with the help of my partner, Vivian, and continued on editing
			my css file.</p>
