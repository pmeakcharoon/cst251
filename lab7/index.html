		<h1>Challenge</h1>
			<p>For this lab, our challenge is to link CSS in our html file. We are to add images
				as well as changing the margin, font, font color, and background colors of
				our site to our taste. We are also adding diffeent values of <div> to our site.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>The only problem that had occured was trying to figure out how to properly
				link the css file as well as figuring out a font and background color that
				I would be satisfied with.</p>
		<h3>Results</h3>
			<p>Although it was difficult trying to format everything to our liking, we
				ended with a successful lab 7 with a css file that was edited to how we
				wanted.</p>
