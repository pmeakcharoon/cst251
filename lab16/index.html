		<h3>Recipes</h3>
		<p>I haven't been able to cook as much as I would like to, but I bought some pasta and pasta sauce!
			I love adding hot links or sausages into my pasta rather than meat balls because I grew up eating it a certain
			a way. Recently, I've been making lazy pasta with garlic powder, some salt, some black pepper,
			and some Thai chili flakes! Very delicious, but I do miss fresh onions and garlic in my pasta. I also
			love this three cheese tomato sauce from Target (it's Target brand), and occasionally I get this spicy
			tomato basil pasta sauce from Walmart, but I don't remember the brand.</p>

				<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Our challenge for this lab is to further play around with background colors, transitions,
					animations, and columbs. We are continuing with Fancy CSS in order to strengthen
					our skills with css and be creative with our html site.</p>

				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The problem that I had with this lab was animating! Looking at the w3 schools code
					confused me a bit more, and I was just unsure of how to do it. Other than that, I
					was able to fix the other issues I had by just experimenting and fixing any mistakes
					that I had. </p>

			<div id="finalresult">
				<h2>Final Result</h2>
					<p>I enjoy how my background looks and how I could create my own. I do with that I could do more with it,
					but I like to keep things simple before building my way up and adding more. This is easier for
					me to retain information due to not doing too much all at once.</p>
