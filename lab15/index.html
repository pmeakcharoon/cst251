		<h3>Spring Break!</h3>
		<p> I spent my spring break hanging out with friends and my boyfriend, and it was
		the best time I've ever had. It's difficullt making new friends that you
		truly connect with, and although there are few that I connected with at this school,
		it doesn't feel the same as my connection with my friends back at home. I do tend
		to get homesick, even though I visit home almost every week with my parents,
		but it helps with my mental health just seeing my friends or my boyfriend for a
		bit and they always comfort me and support me. I'm trying to find some jobs
		to apply to, for when I'm at school and also for when I go home during the weekends,
		so hopefully I can work two jobs just to support myself and build some income. </p>

				<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Our challenge for this lab is to add different effects and filters
				to our index. Another thing we are to do includes adding gradients, shadows
				for our boxes, and testing out object-fit!</p>

				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This lab had to do with a lot of experimenting, so there were some problems that
					I came across, but nothing too difficult that was hard for us to solve.
					Personally, I always have issues with formatting my site to be the way that I want,
					but I was able to fix it. However, I did have a slight issue with how or why
					my CSS CODE text ended up different than the text for my Homepage, but it's okay.
					But besides those, not too many issues this time!</p>

			<div id="finalresult">
				<h2>Final Result</h2>
					<p>I've always stuck with the basic formatting and borders, so I'm glad that
					I was able to play around with borders as well as shadows for this lab. The shadows
					added an extra flare to my site without it being too obvious, which I like! The gradient also made
					my site extra cute, which I am extremely happy about.</p>
