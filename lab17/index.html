		<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge for this lab is to create a grid layout, css layout,
				flexboard layout, and float layout. We are to create four different htmls
				for the four different layouts, as well as a different css for each one.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="box2">
		<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p> I only had a few issues with this lab. I was confused because my css was not working with my html,
					but I figured out the reason why and then fixed it. When it came to this specific index html, I
					didn't have any issues since it just required the basic block elements rather than a specific kind,
					and just focus on the content.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="box3">
		<h2>Final Result</h2>
				<p> It was interesting to see how different I can change the layouts for each html site,
				 while also keeping it organized and not messy. Usually when I mess with certain
			  elements, it turns out not the way that I want or I'm unsatisfied with it. However, I just took
				it easy with this lab and it turned out okay.</p>
