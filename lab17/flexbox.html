			<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this lab is to create a grid layout, css layout,
				flexboard layout, and float layout. We are to create four different htmls
				for the four different layouts, as well as a different css for each one.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="box2">
			<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> The only issues that I had with this layout were getting my CSS to
					 work with my HTML as well as getting a background color for my links and getting
				 	them to align properly. I got my CSS to work with my HTML, I just had some adjustments
					that were quick to solve, but I still couldn't figure out how to the issue with my links. </p>
			</div>

			<div id="box3">
			<h2>Final Result</h2>
					<p> The results were okay, this was a simple layout that was kind of easy
					to learn and do. I do think that the page looks better like this, with the boxes organized
					and right next to each other rather than all over the place or a single box. This is just my
					personal preference when it comes to formatting and organizing my website. </p>
