		<h1> Polly's First CST Website! </h1>
		<p>My name is Patcha Meakcharoon (she/her), but I prefer to go by my nickname, Polly! I am
		currently a second year at CSUMB with a major in CD and concentration in either game
	or visual design. I like to eat ramen and sushi, as well as drinking boba or coffee
(and occasionally tea or smoothies). This is my first time coding and being in computer
related courses, so I'm very excited to learn and hope this works! </p>
