		<h3>Recommendations</h3>
		<p> For shows, I don't have many because I don'r really watch them, but I
		love Fear The Walking Dead, Criminal Minds, American Horror Story. I
		absolutely love anime, so I have a ton that I recommend to watch! My Hero
		Academia, Tokyo Ghoul, Soul Eater, Jujutsu Kaisen, and Demon Slayer are my
		top favorites. </p>

			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>Our challenge for this lab is to create a fake css as well
				as a fake html in order to replicate a website with advanced typography.
				In this lab, we are to add images, blocks, fonts, links, etc., in order
				to accurately replicate the website that we chose from the exmaple given
				to us. </p>

		<div id="problem">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This lab is extremely hard for us to complete, but we managed to communicate
					thouroughly in order to overcome those problems together. We
					had problems relating to formatting as well as getting a font that
					is similar to the font that is in the site. </p>
