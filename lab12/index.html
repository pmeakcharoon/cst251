			<h3>A Bit About Me!</h3>
			<p> My real name is Patcha, but I grew up with people always calling me Polly
				or Paulina :). I am Thai with a bit of Japanese (and I believe Chinese) as well!
				I love skincare, beauty, and fashion (although I'm not very good at it, it still
				interests me and I just love cute clothing and cute makeup packaging),
				and I love to cook! One day, I hope to create my own cute little
				website or a cookbook filled with family recipes that are easy and help people
				feel at home or warm their heart when they're able to taste the foods!</p>

			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge for this lab is a part two of the previous lab. We
				are going to add different forms of div and style it so our texts are centered
				as well as centering our images vertically and horizontally. </p>

				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The problems that I came across would mainly be formatting. My images
					and fonts were not formatted the way I wanted, but I somewhat was able
					to figure it out. I still had trouble formatting my images and my
					links to the homepage and CSS codes, but other than that, I was able
					to figure out my previous issue with the gif background as well
					as adding a different touch to my paragraphs. </p>
		</div>

		<div id="finalresult">
				<h2>Final Result</h2>
					<p>I am somewhat satisfied with my site for this lab. Although I had issues
					with the images and formatting them as well as the links, I was able
					to create a new site with different backgrounds and colors. I
					am satisfied with how the background colors of my paragraphs look, as
					well as playing with the opacity to show the image of the background.</p>
