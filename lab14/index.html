		<h3>Recommendations</h3>
		<p> For songs, I have recently been listening to KPOP because I got bored of
		hearing the same English songs on my playlist and wanted something different.
		I don't have an exact favorite group, but some songs that are nice
		are "Russian Roulette" by RED Velvet, "Psycho" by Red Velvet, "Give It To Me"
		by SISTAR, and "Dope" by BTS. </p>
		And this gif accurately represented Vivian and I during our lab.

			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>Our challenge for this lab is replicate an even more complicated
				website than our lab13.</p>

				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we didn't have any issues besides the image and correct formatting,
					but it was an easy fix. </p>

		<div id="finalresult">
				<h2>Final Result</h2>
					<p>The final result is very surprising. We managed to replicate the website and
					find a similar font as well as an image that was similar to the site we chose. We are
					happy with how lab14 turned out, as well as how we were able to overcome difficulties
					of both labs together :) </p>
