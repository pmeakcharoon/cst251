<h1>Lab 6: More Complicated HTML</h1>
<img src=img/giyuu.jpg>
	<h2>Big Ideas</h2>
		<p>For this lab, my partner and I were to create a forum and add it to
			our source code, link images, and experiment with different tags and
			dividers. We are experimenting with linking our main HTML page as well!</p>
	<h2>Difficulties</h2>
		<p>The difficulties that I encountered when making this were formatting the forms
			and the inputs. It was troubling to me because I had to worry about the
			correct codings for the forum to work, but other than that, I didn't have
			any other issues. </p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>The results shocked me! I was surprised that my website looked amazing
			and to my taste. I'm really happy with the results of my site for this lab!
			The only thing that is bothering me slightly would be how my forum looks,
			but hopefully we can figure out how to fix it in class!</button>
