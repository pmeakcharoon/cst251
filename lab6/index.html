<h1>Lab 6: More Complicated HTML</h1>
<img src=img/giyuu.jpg>
	<h2>Big Ideas</h2>
		<p>For this lab, my partner and I were to create a forum and add it to
			our source code, link images, and experiment with different tags and
			dividers. We are experimenting with linking our main HTML page as well!</p>
	<h2>Difficulties</h2>
		<p>The difficulties that I encountered when making this were formatting the forms
			and the inputs. It was troubling to me because I had to worry about the
			correct codings for the forum to work, but other than that, I didn't have
			any other issues. </p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
